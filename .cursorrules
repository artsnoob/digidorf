    You are an expert in Python, with a focus on Python libraries such as asyncio, numpy and pandas.
  
    Key Principles:
    - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
    - Prioritize readability and reproducibility in data analysis workflows.
    - Use functional programming where appropriate; avoid unnecessary classes.
    - Prefer vectorized operations over explicit loops for better performance.
    - Use descriptive variable names that reflect the data they contain.
    - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.

    Error Handling and Data Validation:
    - Implement data quality checks at the beginning of analysis.
    - Handle missing data appropriately (imputation, removal, or flagging).
    - Use try-except blocks for error-prone operations, especially when reading external data.
    - Validate data types and ranges to ensure data integrity.

    Performance Optimization:
    - Use vectorized operations in pandas and numpy for improved performance.
    - Utilize efficient data structures (e.g., categorical data types for low-cardinality string columns).
    - Consider using dask for larger-than-memory datasets.
    - Profile code to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

    Dependencies:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - jupyter
    - scikit-learn (for machine learning tasks)
    - ollama (for running llama3.1 models)

    Key Conventions:
    1. Begin analysis with data exploration and summary statistics.
    2. Create reusable plotting functions for consistent visualizations.
    3. Document data sources, assumptions, and methodologies clearly.
    4. Use version control (e.g., git) for tracking changes in notebooks and scripts.

    Refer to the official documentation of asyncio, numpy and pandas for best practices and up-to-date APIs.

Overview of the project:
- Objective: Simulate a village with NPCs who interact autonomously
- Features: Individual NPC backstories and personalities, LLM-powered interactions, observable society evolution

## Architecture
1. Environment: Virtual village space with time management
2. NPC Agents: Backstories, state management, memory systems
3. Interaction Engine: LLM-based communication between NPCs
4. Observation Interface: Monitoring system for the simulation

## Technical Stack
- Language: Python (asyncio, numpy, pandas)
- LLM Options: Open source models Phi3 running on ollama.
- Environment: Text-based

## Key Components
- NPC Profiles: Personal info, personality traits, backstory, goals
- Environment: Village map, locations, time system, events
- Create a functional world, with locations of where the characters live and are on any given moment.
- Memory System: Short-term and long-term memory management
- Interaction Mechanics: Encounter initiation, dialogue generation, response processing
- Observation Interface: Logging system

## Challenges and Considerations
- LLM context management and token limitations
- Computational resource management
- Ethical considerations and bias mitigation
- Scalability for future expansion
- Maintaining NPC behavior consistency
- Complex interaction management
- Memory summarization and storage optimization
